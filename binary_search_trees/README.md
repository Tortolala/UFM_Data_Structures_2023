# Binary Search Trees

The file `binary_search_tree.py` contains the class definition of the objects: *Node* and *Binary Search Tree*. While `main.py` holds a few operations done to demonstrate the functionality of the data structure.

## Complexities

| Method                   | Time complexity | Space complexity |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| insert()                 | O(h) = O(n)     | O(n)             |
| search()                 | O(h) = O(n)     | O(n)             |
| find_min()               | O(h) = O(n)     | O(n)             |
| find_max()               | O(h) = O(n)     | O(n)             |
| delete()                 | O(h) = O(n)     | O(n)             |

## Activities

### **Class improvements**

Modify the class definition in order to:

1) Implement the *Delete(key)* operation.

2) Add the corresponding dosctrings to the created methods  (all the operations, not only delete).

    Note: `main.py` must be modify to reflect the changes done.
