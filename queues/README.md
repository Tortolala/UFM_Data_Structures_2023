# Queues 

The file `queue.py` contains the class definition of the object: *Queue*. While `test.py` holds a few operations done to demonstrate the functionality of the data structure.

## Complexities

| Method       | Time complexity | Space complexity |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| enqueue()    | O(1)            | O(n)             |
| dequeue()    | O(1)            | O(n)             |
| search()     | O(n)            | O(n)             |

## Activities

### **Exercise #1: Class improvements**

Create a new version of the class definition in order to:

1) Implement the *Search(key)* operation.

2) Implement the *Peek()* operation.

    Note: `test.py` must be modify to reflect the changes done.


### **Exercise #2: Circular Queue**

Based on the class definition resulting from the previous exercise:

1) Modify the class in order to implement a **Circular Queue**.

2) All operations: enqueue, dequeue, search, and peek must work as expected.  

    Note: `test.py` must be modify to reflect the changes done.
